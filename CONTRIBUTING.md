## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (coming soon).
Please treat everyone with respect and kindness.

## 🛠 Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gentleeduck/duck-ui.git
cd duck-ui
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We use **pnpm** with workspaces:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Build All Packages

```bash
pnpm build
```

### 4. Run in Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will spin up local development environments for the packages and docs.

---

## Working with Packages

* All code lives under the `packages/` directory.
* Each package has its own `package.json` and may depend on other internal packages.
* Use [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) commands to build, test, and lint efficiently.

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Branching**

   * Create a new branch from `main`.
   * Use a descriptive name, e.g. `fix/button-hover`, `feat/new-dialog`, `docs/readme-update`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/new-component
   ```

2. **Coding Standards**

   * Use **TypeScript**.
   * Follow existing **Biome** rules.
   * Write clear, self-documenting code.

3. **Commit Messages**
   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   Also make sure that you pass the `Husky` checks.

   ```
   feat: add new dropdown menu component
   fix: resolve button focus issue in Safari
   docs: update contributing guide
   ```

4. **Testing**

   * Write unit tests for new functionality.
   * Run all tests before pushing:

     ```bash
     pnpm test
     ```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/new-component
   ```

2. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch.

3. Fill out the PR template with:

   * A clear description of your changes
   * Any related issues (`Closes #123`)
   * Screenshots or code samples (if UI related)

## Reporting Issues
