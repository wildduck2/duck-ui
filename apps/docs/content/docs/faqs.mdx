      What makes @gentleduck/ui different from other UI libraries?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      @gentleduck/ui is built as part of a complete ecosystem, not just a collection of components. 
      We've rewritten popular libraries to optimize performance, created custom primitives, and designed 
      APIs that match familiar patterns from other frameworks. Plus, you get a maintainer who actually 
      responds to issues and ships fixes fast.

  <AccordionItem value="item-2" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Is @gentleduck/ui just another Shadcn clone?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      No. While inspired by Shadcn, Radix UI, and Fluent UI, @gentleduck/ui is built from scratch with 
      its own primitives, utilities, and ecosystem. We've taken the best ideas from these libraries and 
      created something faster, more flexible, and more complete. Think of it as evolution, not imitation.

  <AccordionItem value="item-3" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Can I migrate from my current UI library?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Absolutely. Our component APIs are designed to match patterns from popular libraries, making 
      migration smooth and intuitive. You won't need to relearn everything or fight against your muscle 
      memory. Start by migrating one component at a time, or go all in. Both approaches work.

  <AccordionItem value="item-4" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      How do I install and get started?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      It's dead simple. Run <code className="bg-muted px-2 py-1 rounded">npx @gentleduck/cli init</code> to 
      set up your project, then <code className="bg-muted px-2 py-1 rounded">npx @gentleduck/cli add button</code> 
      (or any component name) to install specific components. Import and use them like any other React component. 
      No webpack hell, no peer dependency nightmares.

  <AccordionItem value="item-5" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Is it production ready?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Yes. @gentleduck/ui is battle-tested in production environments. Every component is optimized for 
      performance, accessibility, and reliability. We don't ship half-baked features or leave you hanging 
      with breaking changes. If something doesn't work, it gets fixed ASAP.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="item-6" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      How customizable are the components?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Extremely. Every component supports theme customization, style overrides, and composition patterns. 
      Want to build your own components using our primitives? Go for it. Need to fork and modify something? 
      Do it. We trust you know what you're doing and won't lock you into our opinions.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="item-7" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      What about accessibility?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Accessibility is baked in from day one. ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, 
      focus management - it's all there. We follow WCAG guidelines because shipping inaccessible products 
      in 2025 is inexcusable. Your users deserve better, and we make it easy to deliver.

  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="item-8" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Does it work with TypeScript?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Of course. Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions for all components. You get 
      autocomplete, type checking, and IntelliSense that actually helps instead of getting in your way. 
      Because wrestling with type errors at 2 AM is nobody's idea of fun.

    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      How can I contribute or report issues?

      <a href="https://github.com/gentleeduck/duck-ui" className="text-primary hover:underline">github.com/gentleeduck/duck-ui
      </a>. Report bugs, request features, submit pull requests, or improve documentation. We review 
      contributions quickly and actually respond. Good ideas get implemented, bad ideas get thoughtful

  <AccordionItem value="item-10" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      What's the performance like?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Fast. Really fast. We've optimized bundle sizes, eliminated unnecessary re-renders, and even 
      rewritten some popular libraries to squeeze out every bit of performance. Your components load 
      quickly and stay responsive. We've done the hard work so you don't have to explain slow load 
      times to your manager.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="item-11" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Is there documentation and examples?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Yes. We provide comprehensive documentation, code examples, and real-world use cases. No PhD in 
      computer science required. The docs are written by developers for developers, with the assumption 
      that you're smart enough to figure things out when given clear information.

  <AccordionItem value="item-12" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      What's the license?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      @gentleduck/ui is open source. Use it in personal projects, commercial products, client work - 
      whatever you need. We believe great tools should be accessible to everyone, not locked behind 
      paywalls or restrictive licenses.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="item-13" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Does it support dark mode?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Yes, and it's not an afterthought. Light mode, dark mode, and any custom theme you can imagine. 
      The theming system is flexible enough to handle whatever your design team throws at you. Switch 
      themes dynamically, support user preferences, or go wild with custom color schemes.

  <AccordionItem value="item-14" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Who maintains this project?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      @wildduck2 is the main maintainer, backed by the @gentleduck organization. He's obsessed with 
      building tools that developers actually want to use and is criminally responsive to community 
      feedback. This isn't a side project that'll be abandoned in six months. It's a long-term 
      commitment to making web development better.

  <AccordionItem value="item-15" className="">
    <AccordionTrigger className="">
      Can I use this with Next.js, Remix, or other frameworks?
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
      Absolutely. @gentleduck/ui works with any React-based framework. Next.js, Remix, Vite, Create React 
      App - if it runs React, it runs @gentleduck/ui. We don't play favorites or lock you into specific 
      tooling. Use what works for your project.
