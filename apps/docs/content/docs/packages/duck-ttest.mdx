<Callout>

**TypeScript Type-Level Test Framework**  
Assert your types like you mean it, at compile time.

</Callout>

---

## What is this?

`ttest` is a **zero-runtime** library for writing **type-level tests** in TypeScript.

You spend countless hours designing complex types and systems â€” `ttest` gives you a way to **validate** them with confidence.  
No `console.log`, no runtime hacks, just pure **type assertion** at compile-time.

---

## Features

- **Zero-runtime**: Fully erased at compile time, no emitted JS.  
- **Precise assertions**: Verify assignability, equality, and inference.  
- **IDE-friendly**: Fails type-checking with helpful messages.  
- Works with your favorite setup (`tsc`, `tsd`, `vitest` + `@ts-expect-error`).  
- Designed for duck-typed systems, schema builders, type-safe APIs, and ORMs.  

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @gentleduck/ttest
````

---

## Quick Start

```ts
import { AssertTrue, Equal } from "@gentleduck/ttest";

type Schema = InferSchema<
  "CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT NOT NULL)"
>;

type Test_Column = AssertTrue<
  Equal<Schema["email"], string>,
  'Expected SQL "TEXT" to infer as string'
>;
```

---

## Why Not `tsd` or `expect-type`?

`@gentleduck/ttest` is inspired by them but designed for **framework authors** and **type-heavy codebases**:

* Cleaner API for grouped tests.
* More powerful inference testing.
* Easier integration with custom toolchains.
* Itâ€™s a duck thing ðŸ¦†, it fits your ecosystem.

---

## Advanced Patterns

```ts
import { AssertTrue, Equal } from "@gentleduck/ttest";
import { XOR } from "@gentleduck/utils";

type X1 = XOR<
  { a: number; common: string },
  { b: boolean; common: string }
>;

// expected: { a: number } | { b: boolean }
type Test_X1 = AssertTrue<
  Equal<X1, { a: number } | { b: boolean }>,
  "Expected XOR to produce mutually exclusive union of properties"
>;
```

## Philosophy

<Callout>

Runtime tests test **behavior**.
Type tests test **contracts**.

</Callout>

If youâ€™re building a schema system, compiler, or framework, types *are* your architecture.
You canâ€™t trust what you canâ€™t test.
`@gentleduck/ttest` exists to **close the feedback loop** between your types and your logic.
