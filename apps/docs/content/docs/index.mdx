## What is @gentleduck/ui?

Look, we're not going to waste your time with flowery marketing speak. @gentleduck/ui is a UI 
component library that actually works. It's part of the [@gentleduck](https://github.com/gentleeduck) 
ecosystem a collection of open-source tools built by developers who are tired of fighting their 
frameworks instead of building great products.

We're here to solve real problems: components that don't break when you look at them wrong, 
documentation that doesn't assume you have a PhD in computer science, and a maintainer who 
actually responds to issues. Wild concept, right?

## The Human Behind the Duck

[@wildduck2](https://github.com/wildduck2) is the architect behind [@gentleduck](https://github.com/gentleeduck).
He's not interested in building another abandoned open-source graveyard. He's obsessed with 
creating tools that developers actually want to use performant, maintainable, and battle-tested in 
production environments.

He's also criminally responsive to community feedback. Got a bug? It gets fixed. Got a feature 
request that makes sense? It gets seriously considered. No corporate bureaucracy, no waiting three 
quarters for a minor patch. Just direct, honest development.

The entire [@gentleduck](https://github.com/gentleeduck) organization exists because modern web 
development shouldn't feel like assembling IKEA furniture in the dark. Every library, every tool, 
every decision is made with one question: "Does this actually help developers ship better products 
faster?"

## Why @gentleduck/ui Doesn't Suck

Most UI libraries fall into two camps: gorgeous but impossible to customize, or flexible but uglier 
than a frontend developer's first CSS file. @gentleduck/ui refuses to pick a side.

**What you actually get:**

- **Themes that bend to your will**: Light mode, dark mode, chaos mode customize everything without 
fighting specificity wars or using `!important` like a caveman.

- **Responsive by default**: Your components work on a 4K monitor and a potato phone. No media query 
gymnastics required.

- **Accessibility baked in**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support all there from 
day one because shipping inaccessible products in 2025 is embarrassing.

- **Performance that matters**: These components are optimized to load fast and stay fast. We've 
done the bundle size optimization so you don't have to explain to your manager why your app loads 
like it's 2010.

- **Actually extensible**: Want to modify a component? Go ahead. We won't lock you into our way of 
doing things. Build your own components using our primitives. Fork what you need. We trust 
you're not an idiot.

- **APIs that make sense**: We've designed our component APIs to match patterns from popular 
libraries you already know. Migrating from other UI frameworks? You'll feel right at home. 
No need to relearn everything or fight muscle memory.

## Contributing (Yes, Actually)

We want your contributions. Bug reports, feature requests, code, documentation improvements, 
hot takes on component naming bring it all to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gentleeduck/duck-ui).

Unlike projects run by committees, we move fast. Good ideas get implemented. Bad ideas get 
respectfully declined with actual reasoning. Contributions get reviewed by humans who remember 
what it's like to be on the other side of a pull request.

The [@gentleduck](https://github.com/gentleeduck) community is built on mutual respect and the 
shared understanding that we're all just trying to build cool stuff without losing our minds.

## Getting Started (The Fast Version)

### Install

```bash
npx @gentleduck/cli init
```

### Add Components

```bash
npx @gentleduck/cli add button
```

### Use Them

```jsx
import { DuckButton } from '@/components/ui'

<DuckButton>Actually works on first try</DuckButton>
```

That's it. No webpack configuration hell, no mysterious peer dependency conflicts, no sacrificing a
rubber duck to the JavaScript gods.

## The Origin Story

This started as [@wildduck2](https://github.com/wildduck2)'s side project one of those "I'm tired 
of this nonsense, I'll build it myself" moments that every developer has at 2 AM. But instead of 
collecting digital dust, it evolved into something people actually wanted to use.

Was it inspired by [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), 
[Float UI](https://floating-ui.com/), and others? Absolutely. Great artists steal, and great 
developers learn from what works. But @gentleduck/ui isn't just another clone it's built from the 
ground up with its own primitives, utilities, and ecosystem.

We're standing on the shoulders of giants while building something genuinely different. If you're 
looking for another Shadcn, this isn't it. If you're looking for the fastest, most complete 
component library maintained by someone who gives a damn, welcome home.

## The Ecosystem (Or: How Deep This Rabbit Hole Goes)

Here's where things get interesting. @gentleduck/ui isn't just a component library it's the 
centerpiece of an entire ecosystem built from the ground up for one purpose: being the absolute 
best UI library you'll ever use.

We're talking custom primitives, performance utilities, development tools, and yes rewrites of 
popular libraries that weren't fast enough or flexible enough for what we needed. When existing 
solutions didn't meet our standards, we didn't compromise. We rebuilt them. Better. Faster. More 
aligned with modern web development.

This isn't duct tape and wishful thinking. This is a cohesive, intentionally designed system where 
every piece works together seamlessly. The CLI, the primitives, the utilities, the components 
they're all part of a larger vision to give you the most powerful, performant UI development 
experience possible.

Other libraries give you components. We give you an unfair advantage.
