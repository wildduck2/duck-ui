I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** specializing in building scalable, high-performance systems across the full stack. Currently at AIv, I'm engineering conversational operating systems where natural language serves as the interface for real-world actions. I work with **TypeScript**, **Rust**, **Elixir**, **Node.js**, and modern web technologies to create robust, production-grade applications.

My expertise spans from **zero-dependency libraries** and **Rust-powered tooling** to **AI-driven architectures** and **distributed systems**. I'm passionate about creating developer tools that improve productivity, reduce complexity, and push the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies.

## Philosophy

I believe in building tools that **reduce complexity** while **expanding capability**. Whether it's a zero-dependency component library, a crash-proof logging system, or an AI-powered operating system, my goal is to create software that empowers developers and users alike.

My work focuses on:
- **Performance:** Every millisecond matters in production
- **Developer Experience:** Great tools make great products possible
- **Type Safety:** Catching errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Open Source:** Sharing knowledge and building in public
