GentleDuck is an open source organization building production-grade developer tooling. We exist to reduce friction across the entire development lifecycle, from UI and interaction design to documentation, automation, testing, and systems performance.

Our goal is simple: make it easier for teams to build, evolve, and maintain software at scale without sacrificing correctness, performance, or consistency.

## Why GentleDuck

Modern teams ship fast, but tooling often fragments as systems grow. GentleDuck focuses on creating tools that work well together, share conventions, and stay reliable in real production environments.

We build developer tooling that helps teams move quickly while remaining predictable, maintainable, and scalable over time.

## Our principles

- **Clarity over complexity**  
  Simple, predictable APIs backed by clear documentation and strong conventions.

- **Consistency at scale**  
  Shared UI foundations, registries, templates, and tooling that keep teams aligned as products and teams grow.

- **Performance you can trust**  
  Production-ready tooling designed for real workloads, with performance and reliability treated as first-class concerns.

- **Composable tools**  
  Each library stands on its own, but follows shared patterns that make the ecosystem stronger when used together.

## What we build

GentleDuck is an ecosystem of focused libraries and tools that can be adopted independently or combined as a unified platform.

- **UI and interaction foundations**  
  **duck-ui**, primitives, motion, hooks, and variants provide consistent, accessible building blocks for modern interfaces.

- **Compiler and code generation tooling**  
  Tools like **duck-gen** generate type-safe APIs, routes, message tags, and integrations, reducing boilerplate and enforcing contracts.

- **CLI and automation**  
  Command-line tooling for installing packages, generating code, syncing registries, and standardizing workflows across projects.

- **Testing, data, and state libraries**  
  Utilities for type-level testing, data querying, state management, and reliability that help teams ship safely with confidence.

- **Systems and performance tools**  
  High-performance utilities such as **TTLog**, benchmarking tools, and Linux helpers focused on observability, debugging, and runtime efficiency.

## How the ecosystem fits together

The ecosystem is designed to be modular. You can adopt a single package to solve a specific problem, or lean into shared conventions across UI, tooling, and systems as your product grows.

UI primitives power components, variants standardize APIs, compiler tooling enforces contracts, the CLI keeps installs consistent, and systems tools support performance and observability in production.

## Where to start

If you are new to GentleDuck, start with the ecosystem or products sections to explore individual packages. Choose the tool that solves your biggest pain point first, then expand gradually as your needs grow.

GentleDuck rewards incremental adoption while providing a clear path toward a cohesive, production-ready tooling stack.
